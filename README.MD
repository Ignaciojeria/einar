## Minimum Requirements

- [Golang 1.21](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## üîß Installation
To install EinarCLI, use the following command:

    go install github.com/Ignaciojeria/einar@v1.35.0

To verify your EinarCLI installation, run:

    einar version

## :computer: Usage
#### Starting a new Einar project with the official template
![Diagram](ddd_sketching/einar.drawio.svg)
To use the official EinarCLI template for creating a new project, execute the following command:

    einar init my-project-name https://github.com/Ignaciojeria/einar-cli-template no-auth
    
#### Starting a new Einar project with your custom private template
If you wish to utilize your own corporate private template to initiate a new project, use the following command:

    einar init my-project-name https://github.com/your-corporative-private-einar-cli-template user:token

## üåê  Installing HTTP Server
We are using Echo to manage HTTP requests efficiently. To install the Echo Server, run the following command in your terminal:

    einar install echo-server
    
#### üîç Check Application Port 
To check the port that your HTTP server is using for your application, you can refer to the .env file located in the root directory of your Einar project:

``` .env
# THIS IS REFERENCE FILE OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# DONT STORE YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ON YOUR REPOSITORY!
PORT = "8080"
COUNTRY = "CL"
PROJECT_NAME = "my-project-name"
ENVIRONMENT = "local"
```


#### üîç Run Application
To run the application, you can start it as a traditional Golang application by executing the following command:

    go run main.go

This will start your application on the default port specified in the configuration.

#### üîç Check Running Application Status
To check the status of the running application, visit the following URL in your web browser:

[http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health) 

![Img](ddd_sketching/check_running_application_status.jpeg)

## :hammer: HTTP Server - Inbound Adapter
An HTTP Inbound Adapter is the same as a controller in a web application. To create a new HTTP inbound adapter, we need to execute the following commands:

    einar generate get-controller  get-customer
    einar generate post-controller post-customer
    einar generate put-controller put-customer
    einar generate patch-controller patch-customer
    einar generate delete-controller delete-customer

####  üîç Directory Structure
When running the Einar commands to generate controllers, the following directory structure will be created in your project:

```bash
/app
  /adapter
    /in
      /controller
        - get_customer.go   # Generated with 'einar generate get-controller get-customer'
        - post_customer.go  # Generated with 'einar generate post-controller post-customer'
        - put_customer.go  # Generated with 'einar generate put-controller put-customer'
        - patch_customer.go # Generated with 'einar generate patch-controller patch-customer'
        - delete_customer.go # Generated with 'einar generate delete-controller delete-customer'
```

#### üîç File structure
For example, when you generate a controller using the `einar generate get-controller get-customer` command, Einar CLI will create a new .go file with the following structure:

```go
package controller

func init() {
	container.InjectInboundAdapter(func() error {
		einar.Echo.GET("/INSERT_YOUR_PATTERN_HERE", getCustomer)
		return nil
	})
}

func getCustomer(c echo.Context) error {
	//PUT HERE YOUR HANDLING PROCESS
	return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, "INSERT_YOUR_CUSTOM_RESPONSE")
}
```
In the generated controller template:

- `"/INSERT_YOUR_PATTERN_HERE"` is a placeholder for your route pattern. Replace this with the actual endpoint pattern for your route (for example, `"/customer"` for a route that handles customer data).

- `getCustomer` is the function that handles the route. It currently includes a placeholder comment, `//PUT HERE YOUR HANDLING PROCESS`. Replace this comment with the actual logic that should be executed when a request is made to this route.

- `"INSERT_YOUR_CUSTOM_RESPONSE"` is a placeholder for the response that your route will return. Replace this with the actual response that you want to send back to the client.

Remember to adjust these placeholders according to your project's needs.

For more information on the Echo framework, visit the [Echo documentation](https://echo.labstack.com/).

## üì° Installing Google PubSub
 To install PubSub Client, run the following command in your terminal:

	einar install pubsub

#### üîç Check Pubsub Configuration
After installing Pub/Sub, when you run the application, it will ask you for valid Google application credentials and project ID to start working with Google Pub/Sub.

Make sure to allocate the following configuration in the .env file located at the root of your project:

``` .env
#ENABLE FOR PUBSUB OR FIRESTORE ARCHETYPE INSTALLATION
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID = "gcp-project-id"
#optional and only if you are working with a service account
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "path/of/your/optional/serviceAccount.json"
```

## :hammer: Google PubSub - Inbound Adapter
Creating a new Google PubSub Inbound Adapter, in our case, involves generating a pull subscription to a topic. This can be done by executing the following command:

	einar generate subscription pull-customer-created

####  üîç Directory Structure

```bash
/app
  /adapter
    /in
      /subscription
	- pull_customer_created.go # Generated with 'einar generate subscription pull-customer-created'
```

#### üîç File structure
For example, when you generate a subscription using the `einar generate subscription pull-customer-created` command, Einar CLI will create a new .go file with the following structure:

```go
package subscription

import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"

	"my-project-name/app/exception"
	"my-project-name/app/shared/archetype/container"
	einar "my-project-name/app/shared/archetype/pubsub"
	"my-project-name/app/shared/archetype/pubsub/subscription"
	"my-project-name/app/shared/constants"

	"cloud.google.com/go/pubsub"
)

var pullCustomerCreated = func(ctx context.Context, subscriptionName string, m *pubsub.Message) (err error) {
	var dataModel interface{}
	defer subscription.HandleMessageAcknowledgement(ctx, &subscription.HandleMessageAcknowledgementDetails{
		SubscriptionName: subscriptionName,
		Error:            err,
		Message:          m,
		ErrorsRequiringNack: []error{
			exception.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
		},
		CustomLogFields: map[string]interface{}{
			"dataModel": dataModel,
		},
	})
	if err := json.Unmarshal(m.Data, &dataModel); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}

var pullCustomerCreatedConfig = func() error {
	var subscriptionName = "INSERT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NAME"
	subRef := einar.Client().Subscription(subscriptionName)
	subRef.ReceiveSettings.MaxOutstandingMessages = 5
	settings := subRef.Receive
	go subscription.
		New(subscriptionName, pullCustomerCreated, settings).
		WithPushHandler(constants.DefaultPushHandlerPrefix + subscriptionName).
		Start()
	return nil
}

var _ = container.InjectInboundAdapter(pullCustomerCreatedConfig)
```

## :hammer: Google PubSub - Outbound Adapter
Creating a new Google PubSub Outbound Adapter, in our case, involves generating a publisher that sends messages to a Google Cloud topic. This can be done by executing the following command:

	einar generate publisher publish-customer

####  üîç Directory Structure

```bash
/app
  /adapter
    /out
      /publisher
	- publish_customer.go # Generated with 'einar generate publisher publish-customer'
```

#### üîç File structure
For example, when you generate a publisher using the `einar generate publisher publish-customer` command, Einar CLI will create a new .go files with the following structure:

```go
package pubsub

import (
	"archetype/app/domain/ports/out"
	einar "archetype/app/shared/archetype/pubsub"
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"

	"cloud.google.com/go/pubsub"
)

var PublishCustomer = func(ctx context.Context, REPLACE_BY_YOUR_DOMAIN map[string]string) error {

	bytes, err := json.Marshal(REPLACE_BY_YOUR_DOMAIN)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return err
	}

	message := &pubsub.Message{
		Attributes: map[string]string{
			"customAttribute1": "attr1",
			"customAttribute2": "attr2",
		},
		Data: bytes,
	}
	// einar.Topic("INSERT YOUR TOPIC NAME HERE") returns an instance of *pubsub.Topic type.
	// For more details, please consult the documentation here: https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/pubsub#section-readme
	result := einar.Topic("INSERT YOUR TOPIC NAME HERE").Publish(ctx, message)

	// Get the server-generated message ID.
	messageID, err := result.Get(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		// Handle the error
		fmt.Println("Error occurred while publishing the result:", err.Error())
		// Perform any necessary error handling actions
		return err
	}

	// Successful publishing
	fmt.Println("Message published with ID:", messageID)
	return nil
}
```

## üî• Installing Google Firestore
To install Firestore Client, run the following command in your terminal:

	einar install firestore

#### üîç Check Firestore Configuration
After installing Firestore, when you run the application, it will ask you for valid Google application credentials and project ID to start working with Firestore.

Make sure to allocate the following configuration in the .env file located at the root of your project:

``` .env
#ENABLE FOR PUBSUB OR FIRESTORE ARCHETYPE INSTALLATION
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID = "gcp-project-id"
#optional and only if you are working with a service account
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "path/of/your/optional/serviceAccount.json"
```

## :hammer: Google Firestore - Outbound Adapter
Creating a new Google Firestore Outbound Adapter, in our case, involves generating a repository that does database operations to a specific firestore collection. This can be done by executing the following command:

	einar generate firestore-repository save-customer

####  üîç Directory Structure

```bash
/app
  /adapter
    /out
      /firestore
	- save_customer.go # Generated with 'einar generate firestore-repository save-customer'
```

#### üîç File structure
For example, when you generate a repository using the `einar generate firestore-repository save-customer` command, Einar CLI will create a new .go files with the following structure:

```go
package firestore

import (
	"archetype/app/domain/ports/out"
	einar "archetype/app/shared/archetype/firestore"
	"context"
	"cloud.google.com/go/firestore"
)

var SaveCustomer = func(ctx context.Context, REPLACE_BY_YOUR_DOMAIN map[string]string) error {
	// einar.Collection("INSERT_YOUR_COLLECTION_CONSTANT_HERE") returns an instance of *firestore.CollectionRef type.
	// For more details, please consult the documentation here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart?hl=es-419#go
	var _ *firestore.CollectionRef = einar.Collection("INSERT_YOUR_COLLECTION_CONSTANT_HERE")
	return nil
}
```
