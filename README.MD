![Diagram](ddd_sketching/einar.drawio.svg)
To use the official EinarCLI template for creating a new project, execute the following command:

    einar init my-project-name https://github.com/Ignaciojeria/einar-cli-template no-auth
    
#### Starting a new Einar project with your custom private template
If you wish to utilize your own corporate private template to initiate a new project, use the following command:

    einar init my-project-name https://github.com/your-corporative-private-einar-cli-template user:token

## 🔧 Installing HTTP Server
We are using Echo to manage HTTP requests efficiently. To install the Echo Server, run the following command in your terminal:

    einar install echo-server
    
#### 🔍 Check Application Port 
To check the port that your HTTP server is using for your application, you can refer to the .env file located in the root directory of your Einar project

#### 🔍 Run Application
To run the application, you can start it as a traditional Golang application by executing the following command:

    go run main.go

This will start your application on the default port specified in the configuration.

#### 🔍 Check Running Application Status
To check the status of the running application, visit the following URL in your web browser:

[http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health)

## :hammer: HTTP Server - Inbound Adapter
An HTTP Inbound Adapter is the same as a controller in a web application. To create a new HTTP inbound adapter, we need to execute the following commands:

    einar generate get-controller  get-customer
    einar generate post-controller post-customer
    einar generate put-controller put-customer
    einar generate patch-controller patch-customer
    einar generate delete-controller delete-customer
